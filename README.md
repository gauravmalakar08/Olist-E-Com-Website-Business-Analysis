# Olist E-Com Website Business Analysis

## Introduction

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of a Brazilian e-commerce platform known as Olist, which connects merchants to customers seeking various products and services. The dataset, publicly available, offers Data Analysts an opportunity to delve into Brazil's e-commerce landscape, identifying avenues for growth and optimization and the business outcomes.

Undertaken as part of an online data analysis challenge, this project allowed me to leverage Power BI for comprehensive analysis. By using DAX functions and data modeling techniques, I aimed to uncover actionable insights that highlight potential growth opportunities and optimizations for the Olist platform, while also honing my skills in Power BI.

##About the Data

The raw data was gotten from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). It contains 9 tables which are Olist_customers, Olist_geolocation, Olist_order_items, Olist_order_payments, Olist_order_reviews, Olist_orders, Olist_products, Olist_sellers, Product_category_name. These tables contain a wide range of information about each order, including the order date, product details, payment and shipping information, customer and seller IDs, customer reviews, sellers who list their products on Olist, as well as data on customer behaviour and demographics. You can check out the data dictionary for description of the tables' contents.
